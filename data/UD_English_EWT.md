Al-Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al-Ani, the preacher at the
mosque in the town of Qaim, near the Syrian border. [This killing of a respected
cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come.] DPA: Iraqi authorities
announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad. Two of
them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior! The MoI in
Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI, so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover
unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the
1960s. The third was being run by the head of an investment firm. You wonder if
he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets. The cells were
operating in the Ghazaliyah and al-Jihad districts of the capital. Although the
announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up
terror cells, I don't find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the
Iraqi government very hopeful. It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who
were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam. Al-Zaman : Guerrillas
killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul.
The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80
percent in Mosul, whereas there had been a big jump in the number of
kidnappings....
